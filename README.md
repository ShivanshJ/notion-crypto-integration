## 2. Create a Notion table
1. Create a notion database by typing `/database`.
2. Select `Database - Inline`
3. Create the following column with names:
    a. `Name` â†’ for coin Name (BTC)
    b. `api id` â†’ Add the amount you bought the stock units with
    c. `Current Price` â†’ Get's the current price

ðŸ’¡ The above is only for live price tracking,.
ðŸ’¡ You can add more live columns supported by coinGecko by changing the code.
ðŸ’¡ Feel free to add any other columns on top of this as you like. Like your `avg buy price` etc.

4. Get database ID.
    a. Click on 3 dots `...` of the database you create
    b. Click `Copy Link To View`.
    c. Open the copied URL in a new page.
```
https://www.notion.so/fer6ff3d5fcs3dff1d2134349192cc?v=4rf43545...
                     |---------Database ID----------|
```
> Copy & Paste the above ðŸ”‘Â `Database ID` in my_variable.yml ðŸ”’Â file.



## Running Python Script:

**The final part of the integration is about running a python script that will update the real stock prices for all the stock units you have in the database.**
